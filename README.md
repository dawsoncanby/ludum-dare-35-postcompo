The theme was shapeshifting, I decided to make a doodle jump style platformer where the player could switch between two characters with different abilities.

# How to Play:
The monkey can hang on branches and jump between them (watch out for unstable, dead branches), the bird must catch air drafts to recieve a boost.

# Controls:
Enter to start  
W to jump  
A and D to move  
Spacebar to shapeshift  

# PS4 controls:
Connect a PS4 controller! (may require refresh of web page)  
options button to start  
left stick to move  
x to jump  
triangle to shapeshift
